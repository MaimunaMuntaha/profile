                    I used React.js and SQL to code a wellbeing app with a Login
                    And Create Account Screen. With Stack Navigation, users then
                    login and with the auth, are redirected to Feed where they
                    can access their own "Status Updates" or their friends'
                    "Status Updates". Then, in the Future tab, users will write
                    down how they are feeling. Using the Gemini API, an AI
                    generated response will appear alongside a wellbeing task
                    for the user to implement. The last tab is a Profile Tab
                    where Users can search for other users' usernames and add
                    them as friends so that those friends' statuses appear on
                    the main Feed page. To code the backend database for the
                    App, I used Supabase and multiple SQL queries and RLS
                    policies.

                  Voice Feedback systems
                </h3>
                <div>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    I worked on a HCI study with two other Stanford Students
                    investigating the impact of user involvement in error
                    detection and correction on transcription accuracy and user
                    satisfaction. We developed and evaluated three variations of
                    a voice dictation system with Python:
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-5">
                    Control: Users receive only audio playback of the
                    transcription at the end of the speaking section.
                  </p>

                  <p class="mb-5">
                    Variation 1: Live transcription with immediate feedback on
                    proper noun spellings while the user is still speaking.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-5">
                    Variation 2: This variation provides feedback after the user
                    completes their recording where the system first plays back
                    the full transcription. Afterward, it plays back a proper
                    noun check with all the proper nouns detected, followed by
                    the spelling of each proper noun. This variation also
                    provides the user with an opportunity to fix any errors, by
                    saying the corrections they want to make.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    These findings reveal that post-transcription feedback
                    (Variation 2) significantly improved transcription accuracy,
                    achieving a near-perfect proper noun error rate of 0.9%, and
                    was preferred by users for its structured correction
                    process. By contrast, live transcription feedback (Variation
                    1) demonstrated some benefits but was less effective due to
                    the interruptions it introduced. Our findings will
                    contribute to the development of more accessible and
                    adaptive technologies, bridging gaps in communication and
                    enhancing usability for individuals with diverse needs,
                    including those in screenless or hands-free environments.

                  NASA Machine Learning Model
                </h3>
                <div>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    Although I cannot share the website or code, as it is in
                    development and provate government information, I can
                    provide my project poster. As part of the CCRI Team, me and
                    my team analyzed the relationship between air temperature
                    and land surface temperature (LST) on a variety of scales.
                    At the largest scale, air temperatures from Automated
                    Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) and the New York Urban
                    Hydro-meteorological Testbed (UHMT) were compared with
                    four-daily LST measurements from NASA’s Moderate Resolution
                    Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 8 stations around New
                    York City and 227 stations globally. The main result is that
                    LST is disproportionately warmer than air temperature
                    whenever the ambient air temperatures are warmer, such as
                    during the day, in the summer, at urban locations, and at
                    lower latitudes, and at more humid locations. On the
                    smallest scale, over one hundred students have collected air
                    temperature and LST measurements through field campaigns
                    during class periods at Baruch College Campus High School
                    throughout the year and NSF’s Implementing Novel Solutions
                    for Promoting Cultural Change in Geoscience Research and
                    Education program in the summer of 2023 and 2024. Teaching
                    high school students about research while engaging
                    environmental justice organizations, like WE ACT for
                    Environmental Justice, is an unprecedented opportunity for
                    the next generation of scholars. Thermal images gathered by
                    students have been used with machine learning and
                    segmentation to predict a thermal image given a visual
                    image. The segmentation (e.g., separating pavement vs.
                    grass) has greatly improved the performance of the model and
                    thermal patterns in the predictions have been reasonably
                    accurate. This interdisciplinary opportunity to connect
                    students with NASA researchers provides unprecedented
                    exposure to current climate change research.

                  Predictive Policing Algorithm Bias
                </h3>
                <div>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    In Python, I used prior NYPD statistics to recreate a
                    different version of the predictive policing model created
                    for the NYPD by HunchLab. For reference, the Brennan Center
                    filed a Freedom of Information Law (“FOIL”) request for
                    information about the New York Police Department’s (NYPD)
                    purchase of predictive policing software on June 14, 2016,
                    made by Azavea. This FOIL complaint was made in fear of what
                    harmful bias may be used in the data that the NYPD uses for
                    its future activity and patrolling. According to the Brennan
                    Center for Justice, Azavea wanted specific NYPD data for
                    implementing its predictive policing software. This included
                    basic crime information such as, “crime type, location, and
                    date, as well as extensive environmental information,
                    including the locations of schools, hospitals, subway
                    entrances, mental health facilities, methadone clinics, pawn
                    shops, liquor licenses, restaurants, and laundry facilities”
                    (Brennan Center for Justice). I used Bayesian concepts to
                    find these posterior probabilities given certain user
                    inputs. I researched NYPD and NYC Demographic Reports to
                    collect the statistics I needed. Then I cross-referenced
                    data and wrote a program with this data that takes in the
                    user's "given" information and outputs the probability that
                    a crime occurs given the neighborhood and other demographics
                    a crime occurs in and compares different crimes and their
                    respective probabilities in various boroughs. By mapping
                    this data, I showed the biases AI models can inherit from
                    historical crime data which lead to discriminatory policing
                    practices. I observed how certain areas (particularly more
                    socioeconomically disadvantaged areas) are more likely to be
                    targeted by predictive policing algorithms.
